# 20-Questions-Python-Example
20 Questions Example Game, (TRIAL VERSION)
A basic example of how a 20 Questions game could be made, improvements could be made by having external lists 
saved in files outside of the code to reduce amount of code.

Shows skills in organising complicated nested conditional statements and expressions, offering a labyrinth of possible outputs.
Could be useful for RPG Dungeons & Dragons style game, etc...
